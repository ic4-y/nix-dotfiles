# Documentation Generation Plan for New Features

## Overall Goal

Generate comprehensive documentation for the new features within the `docs/` directory, following the numbering provided, with a focus on technical implementation details for advanced users or AI agents.

## High-Level Plan

1.  **Detailed Planning for Each Feature:** For each feature, I will outline the content, structure, and any specific resources to be used. Each document will be a dedicated markdown file in the `docs/` directory.
2.  **Mermaid Diagram:** I will provide a Mermaid diagram to visualize the overall documentation generation workflow.
3.  **User Review:** I will present this detailed plan to you for review and approval.
4.  **Write to Markdown (Optional):** If the plan is approved, I will ask if you would like this plan written to a markdown file.
5.  **Switch Mode:** Once the plan is finalized, I will request to switch to `code` mode to begin implementing the documentation.
